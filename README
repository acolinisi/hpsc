# Parent repository for the HPSC project

Holds references to commits of all repositories of HPSC project.
Each commit in this repository designates a consistent snapshot
of the HPSC codebase, i.e. an internal release.

Clone this repository with the recursive flag:

    $ git clone -r git@github.com:acolinisi/hpsc.git

## Guide

After work in child repos has been committed and pushed,
check which repos have been modified:

    $ git status
        modified: child-repo-A (new commits)
        modified: child-repo-B (modified content)

The "new commits" log means that the currently checked out child repo
is at a commit that differs from the last snapshot recorded in this
parent repo. The difference may be in either direction: git reset to
an earlier commit in the child repo will produce the same message.

The "modified content" means that the checked out child repo has uncommitted
modification. First, commit those changes in the child repo.

Once git status shows "new commits" for all modified repos and the commits of
each child repo has been pushed to the respective remote, then it's ready to be
tested, snapshot via a commit to this parent repo, and pushed.

To capture a new consistent snapshot after child repos have been modified,
compose a description of the overall global change, and commit:

    $ git add child-repo-A  child-repo-B ...
    $ git commit
    $ git push

### Branches

When changing the checked out commit this repo (by checking out, switching
branches, pulling), the checked out trees of the submodules will only be
updated on your explicit request via the `submodule update` command:

    $ git checkout branch-A
    $ git submodule update

If there are local modifications in the checking out tree of a submodule, and
the submodule reference was modified in the parent repo (e.g. in the branch of
the parent repo being switched into), then the update may fail with the usual
message about checkout being disallowed due to local modifications.

If the change being switched into adds submodules then, the new submodules
need to be initialized:

    $ git submodule init
